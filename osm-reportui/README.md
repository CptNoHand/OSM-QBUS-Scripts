# OSM | ReportUI | An Alternate to Existing PLAYER Report System with DISCORD SUPPORT| UI constructed with HTML, CSS, JS, and BOOTSTRAP

A standalone Reporting System for FiveM Servers, with a COOL UI for both Players and Admins. Works using DISCORD WEBHOOKS. It allows Victims to report a player with as much detail as they want to give, and for Admins, returns all what is required for a REPORT to be fully investigated. 

### Features
- Standalone, thus can be used on ANY FRAMEWORKS without worrying about Conversions/Renaming/etc. 
- A soft and cool UI for players to file reports, that can be opened using `/reportui`.
- Discord Webhook Returns literally all the identifiers of the Accused. 
- Easy to Setup :)

### SETUP 
- Script's FOLDER NAME should be set to `osm-reportui`. Using other names will break the script if not edited properly.
- Set DISCORD WEBHOOK in `server.lua`. 

### CREDITS

- Ariz for providing basic JS for recieving responses. 
- MonkeyWhisper for Testing 

This is my first ever attempt to WORK WITH HTML, CSS, JS etc. I haven't made any UI's before. So please excuse me for any Bugs. You can always FIX and create Pull Requests.
